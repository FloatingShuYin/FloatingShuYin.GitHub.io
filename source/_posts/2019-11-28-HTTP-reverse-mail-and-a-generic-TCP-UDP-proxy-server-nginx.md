## 资源

## nginx

### 安装
```fish
brew install nginx
```

```
==> nginx
Docroot is: /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/var/www

The default port has been set in /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080 so that
nginx can run without sudo.

nginx will load all files in /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/etc/nginx/servers/.

Warning: nginx provides a launchd plist which can only be used on macOS!
You can manually execute the service instead with:
  nginx
```
